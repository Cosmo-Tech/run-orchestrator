!!! danger "Known Issues"
    A known issue exists with simulator having QT consumers and the orchestrator, due to QT and X shenanigans we can't forward the current X server info to the simulator resulting in QT consumers crashing.  
    You can suppose that any script running through the orchestrator won't have access to a graphical interface since they should be able to run on docker containers in the cloud.
