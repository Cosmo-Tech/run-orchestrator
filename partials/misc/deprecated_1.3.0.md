!!!danger "Breaking change"
    **This command is no longer functional since 1.3.0**  
    Equivalent commands have been added to `csm-data` a part of `CosmoTech-Acceleration-Library`.  
    Trying to run this command will give you the equivalent command to use with `csm-data`.  
    ```bash title="Install csm-data"
    pip install CosmoTech-Acceleration-Library~=0.7.0
    ```
    This command will be fully removed in a future version.
